      <h2>Platform-Specific Contribution Tracking</h2>
      <p>The tool is designed to calculate each platform's individual share of social security contributions for gig workers. This solves a major operational challenge:</p>
      
      <h3>The Multi-Platform Problem:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A delivery driver might work for Zomato, Swiggy, and Dunzo in the same month</li>
        <li>A ride-hailing driver could be active on Uber, Ola, and local platforms</li>
        <li>Each platform only sees their portion of the worker's activity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How this calculator helps:</h3>
      <p>Each platform can use this tool to calculate their proportional responsibility based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of workers engaged through their platform per month</li>
        <li>The platform's share of social security contribution per worker</li>
        <li>Their specific obligation regardless of what other platforms the worker uses</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Clearing the confusion:</h3>
      <p>Instead of platforms arguing "this worker also works elsewhere, so it's not our responsibility," this system establishes that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each platform pays based on their usage of the worker</li>
        <li>No double-counting or gaps - every platform pays their fair share</li>
        <li>Transparent calculation - standardized method across all platforms</li>
        <li>Scalable tracking - can handle workers across multiple platforms simultaneously</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This is particularly crucial for implementing India's gig worker social security schemes where the law requires platforms to contribute, but doesn't clearly specify how to handle multi-platform workers. The calculator essentially creates a pro-rata system where each platform's contribution is proportional to their engagement with the worker.</p>
